#SpotiBeer

**A full-stack app that generates a playlist based on the style of a beer using the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/), [EchoNest API](http://developer.echonest.com/) and [BreweryDB](http://www.brewerydb.com/).**

####What is SpotiBeer?

SpotiBeer was created because I was interested in craft beers and music. It also reminded me of the good ol' college days when we were all stuck with holding a red cup drinking PBR or Rainier. If we're lucky, we'll get our hands on some Rolling Rock. It was a fun and challenging experience because it was the first app that I have ever built. 

####Process

I focused more on the aesthetics this time round but going forward, I would like to add more features. 

Right now, the app is hosted on Heroku and only made available for Spotify users. With the help of my instructors, I was able to get OAuth 2.0 going. If I had more time, I will definitely fiddle more with the database and also allow users to save their playlists in real-time so they could listen to them while having their favorite beer.

**Timeframe:** 1 week
